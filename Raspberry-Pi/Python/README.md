Raspberry Pi Development in Python
==================================

Files:
	Bit_rPi.py			This is the NEW low level Bit() class used by other classes

	LED-rPi.py			Contains my LED class for the BeagleBone (Black)

	LedPlay-rPi.py		Contains my BitPlay class and some code to demo it. This
							requires my LED class to work.
						
						This class contains fun stuff like a KnightRider function,
							as well as a nice binary up/down counter, and a setBits()
							function that allows you to set any binary value (0 - 255)
							on the 8 LEDs.
							
						These are all 8 bit routines, so they require 8 LEDs to be wired
							up to your BeagleBone (Black).
